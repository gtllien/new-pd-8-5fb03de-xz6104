(The 1st rabies vaccination is good for one year.)</p><p><em>This is the perfect time to spay/neuter your pet.</em></p><p>We also recommend starting your kitten on flea preventative at this time.</p><p>Once your kitten has finished the schedule listed above, he/she is okay to go one year before the next set of vaccinations is given.</p><p>Dogs, and cats alike, should see the vet at least once a year. It is important to have your animal examined yearly.</p><p></p><h2><br><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Heartworm Preventative</span></h2><p>We recommend that ALL cats and dogs, both young and old, are on heartworm preventative at all times. Here in the state of Texas, heartworms are all too common. All animals are exposed to mosquitoes, which is how heartworms are transmitted. Even the most sheltered inside dog is at risk. Dogs and cats should be placed on heartworm preventative before they reach 6 months of age. Heartworm prevention also protects your pet against intestinal worms.</p><p>It is very important to make sure they receive their medication every month. Periodically, a heartworm test will be performed by your vet to make sure that your pet is healthy enough to continue on the medication. This is a lifelong measure of preventative care. It is one of the most important ways you can take care of your pet.</p><h2><br><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Flea Preventative</span></h2><p>We recommend that your pets be placed on flea preventative as soon as possible. Fleas are rampant here in Texas. They are pesky little bugs that will make your animal, and you, very uncomfortable. Don’t let the fleas take over your pet and your home. Take pre-emptive measures to make sure there’s never an infestation. Always be cautious when purchasing medications from a department or grocery store. Sometimes they can do more harm than good.</p><h2><br><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Spaying and Neutering</span></h2><p>We consider spaying and neutering your pet to be just as important as vaccinations when it comes to preventative care. By altering your animal when he or she is young, you greatly reduce the chances of specific cancers later in life. For instance, in females, the chance of mammary cancer is much greater in animals that went through one or more heat cycles before being spayed. Also, females have a risk of pyometra if they are not altered. Pyometra is an infection of the uterus that can cause serious illness and even death if not treated immediately.</p><p>It is always a good idea to spay or neuter your pet if you do not plan on breeding them. Your family will avoid a lot of hassle and mess if you take care of this early. We perform altering as early as 16 weeks of age.</p><p></p>"
